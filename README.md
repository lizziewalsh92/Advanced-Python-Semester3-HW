# Advanced-Python-Semester3-HW
*Homework folders for Sandeep Junnarkar's Practical Python for News Investigations data course at the Craig Newmark J-School, Semester 3, Fall 2025.* \

NOTE: Any AI code-line help is annotated within docs as: *I USED CHAT GPT/ANACONDA NAVIGATOR TO HELP WITH THIS LINE*

## Course overview:
1. Learn advanced Python techniques
2. Scrape, extract, and process data from websites, text files, and PDFs.
3. Natural Language Processing (NLP): convert words and phrases into data points to measure their frequency or to analyze their contex. Implement NLP for pattern detection, entity extraction, sentiment, and topic modeling.
4. Use AI to brainstorm approaches, write & debug code, and suggest investigative angles.
5. Evaluate AI outputs for accuracy, bias, and relevance; explore pitfalls and drawbacks to chatbots for code/data analysis/text analysis.
6. Build reproducible, efficient investigative workflows that blend Python and AI.
